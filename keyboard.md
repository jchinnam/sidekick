![](/img/huoji.jpg)
- Fn + /? (original): change between RGB modes

### change base color of board
out of the box it was red, I changed to all white (pinkish because of the red switches)
- go to custom mode (the setting after breathing mode)
- hold Fn + A for 3 seconds to go to edit mode
- use Fn + enter to cycle through full colors
when you get to the one you like, stop 

### change color of individual keys
- press keys individually to cycle through colors until 
- when done, to save the overall custom setup, hold Fn + A again
- switch between modes until you get to the rgb mode (chose single key change)

## other notes
mostly from some guy's amazon review

- if the windows key isn't working, press Alt + Win until it does (this changes the OS mode)


on custom keys
- hold Fn + A for 3 seconds to color your keyboard however you want, cycling through every color one key at a time--the easiest way to go about this is to use Fn + Enter to color what you want the majority of your keyboard to be then customize everything else individually
- press Fn + A to save your custom layout. You can do the same with Fn + S for a 2nd custom layout. And then press the \| key to switch between the two layouts or press Fn + A or Fn + S to pick one.

on custom rgb modes
- Fn + /? key changes the pattern of the keyboard
- the custom mode doesn't account for brightness, speed or patterns. It also doesn't simply change to it when pressing Fn + \|, Fn + A or Fn + S, you have to cycle through /? to get to single color mode first or else these custom mode keys will do nothing
- if you don't want to navigate your way to try to turn on custom mode, going into custom setup real quick (hold Fn + A or S for 3 sec and then press again to save) will be the closest to instant as possible to take you there.
- modes
  - 1: rainbow
  - 2: ripple
  - 3: ripple row only
  - 4: single key color change
  - 5: mode 4 and its surrounding keys
  - 6: breathing
  - 7: single keyboard color (and custom mode)
  - 8: basically Tetris / wall building

on caps lock
- the caps lock will light a different color depending on the base keyboard color, and won't change color unless the single keyboard color changes. This means that if the keyboard is green, the caps lock will always be pink even when changing the pattern of the keyboard or changing the color to rainbow.
- green keyboard -> pink caps lock and vice versa
- blue keyboard -> yellow caps lock & vv
- white keyboard -> blue caps lock
- red keyboard -> cyan caps lock & vv
- off -> rotate a full cycle of caps lock colors

on battery
- the spacebar also stays a constant blue when it's charging and will breath slowly when it's dying
- the backlights turn off after a minute to save power when on wireless mode which is nice
- when the keyboard is plugged in, the backlights will always stay on

on bluetooth
- the 3 button bluetooth function is nifty, but sometimes the Q/W/ or E button start flashing for no reason--the only way to get Q/W/or E to stop lighting up is to not use bluetooth
- if you like seeing feedback for every time Fn is pressed, you will like the bluetooth function, which will still do it even when the keyboard is plugged in, depending on the toggle of Fn + R

remember to press Fn + Shift + Esc for the tilda
